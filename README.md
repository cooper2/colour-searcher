# colour-searcher
Colour searcher made with React table

code in src/App.js

node modules may need to be installed, please contact me if any issues


search currently only works with hex values!

While I couldn't figure out how to get a working implementation of this, 
the algorithm I would use when showing similar colours would be to list colours that have 
each RGB component value within a certain distance from the RGB values of the searched colour, 
ranked by order of shortest distance.

also to-do is displaying the actual colours in the table!
